TODO:

- Bug fix:
	- Building VisionEgg Text stimulus in real time will lag the sweep for 2ms. I have to write my fast text stimulus to display info.
	  by Phil's pyGame Utilities. 

- Requested Feature:
	
	- add Preference module to serialize the preference parameter objects
	- screen gamma calibration
	- specifying 2/3 or 4 viewports in client code
	- create a global vsynctable for SweepTableController so that runtime modification could be easier.
	- GUI control of the LightStim with WxPython and pyro
    
DESIGN:
	- Since once sweep go runs, the simulus in every viewport no matter whether it's active or current or visible the controllers of that stimulus are always 
	  evaluated by the sweep go function. So if the stimulus has a trigger controller it will will never stop triggering external device. The stimulus onset/offset and 
	  characterization should be included in the trigger stamp by the trigger controller itself. Sweep and Viewport will never handle that thing.
	- Event handlers are like regulatory genes.They run when the environment has changed. While controllers are house-keeping genes which maintains basic program functions.
	  

MEMO:
	Test-driven development is urgently needed.
	Beautiful is better than ugly. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Sparse is better than dense.
	
DONE:
	+ stimulus can be copied from one viewport to another (copy stimulus is too complicated, try copy stimulus parameters)
	- If multiple viewports with same name are created, are all these stimuli drawn in the screen? Nope,the former drawn viewport will be overlaid by the later ones.
	+ add Mask in mangrating
	+ add viewport position rectification
	- (BUG) viewport_control cannot display information of the viewport in control
	+ control each viewport individually 
	- (BUG) remove replicated event handler in subclass of manstimulus 
	+ add manbar and mangrating demos
	+ add pause_sweep_controllers for FrameSweep (But it's useless. On what condition should the neuron respond to static stimulus?)
	- event state should stay in each viewport? But we cannot. Because all 4 viewports are in one pygame screen.
	- logger doesn't work (logger should have handler. Use the logger in visionegg instead.)
	. clean up init call in subclass of SweepTableController using *args etc.
	+ multiple screen stimulus (pygame implementation)
	. Code Refactoring: use object composition instead of class inheritance to build new functionality
