Welcome to the RealTimeElectrophy!

OVERVIEW

The RealTimeElectrophy is a collection of useful programs designed to simplify visual 
neurophysiology research. The Experimenter package lies in the central position of the routines. 
A experimenter controls the visual stimulator via StimControl and receives spikes data from 
SpikeRecord.  Precise frame timing is done by StimControl which sends a sweepstamp trigger to 
the acquisition system for each screen sweep. Once the visual stimuli is synchronized with the 
spikes via Experimenter, preliminary data analysis can be performed in real time.

INSTALLATION

To install from source, type this from a command line 
from the RealTimeElectrophy base directory (not implement right now):

python setup.py install
