Welcome to the RealTimeElectrophy!

OVERVIEW

The RealTimeElectrophy is a collection of useful programs designed to simplify visual 
neurophysiology research. The Experimenter package lies in the central position of the routines. 
A experimenter controls the visual stimulator via StimControl and receives spikes data from 
SpikeRecord.  Precise frame timing is done by StimControl which sends a sweepstamp trigger to 
the acquisition system for each screen sweep. Once the visual stimuli is synchronized with the 
spikes via Experimenter, preliminary data analysis can be performed in real time.
